Archiving and Logging Data
Hello, Ralph!
Congratulations on an outstanding homework assignment! You've demonstrated your archive and log management system skills!
On the same note, you did a great job with creating, extracting, compressing, and managing tar backup archives. You were able to implement the commands to extract the Tardocs, create the Javaless archive, and ensure that Java/ is not located in the new archive. You also provided the critical analysis explanation about -x versus -c. 

This is an excellent job automating tasks with cron jobs. You were able to create a cron job for backing up the /var/log/auth.log file. You've done a great job with this deliverable.

Also, you have done well in writing your basic bash scripts. You were able to use commands to create the four subdirectories, a system.sh script, and a command to make the system.sh script executable.

Now, you have done awesome work managing the log files! The logrotate config file edits were edited to apply the following settings: rotates weekly, rotates only the seven most recent logs, does not rotate empty logs, delays compression, and ignores missing logs!

This has been an amazing start to understanding how to manage logs, research, and apply new features. Keep up the good work and this smooth flow you've established!
